# BankManagementSystem
**Introduction**

The “Bank Account Management System” project is a model Internet Banking Site. This site 
enables the customers to perform the basic banking transactions by sitting at their office or at 
homes through PC or laptop. The system provides the access to the customer to create an 
account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present. 
The customers can access the banks website for viewing their Account details and perform the 
transactions on account as per their requirements. With Internet Banking, the brick and mortar 
structure of the traditional banking gets converted into a click and portal model, thereby giving a 
concept of virtual banking a real shape. Thus, today's banking is no longer confined to branches. 
E-banking facilitates banking transactions by customers round the clock globally.

**Abstract**

The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a 
bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic 
functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial 
applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end 
banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also, to enable the user’s 
work space to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional 
banking project. 

**AIM of this project**
 
The main aim of designing and developing this Internet banking System Java primarily based  
Engineering project is to provide secure and efficient net banking facilities to the banking 
customers over the internet. Apache Server Pages, MYSQL database used to develop this bank 
application where all banking customers can login through the secured web page by their account 
login id and password. Users will have all options and features in that application like get money 
from western union, money transfer to others, and send cash or money to inter banking as well as 
other banking customers by simply adding them as payees.

**Main Purpose**

The Traditional way of maintaining details of a user in a bank was to enter the details and record 
them. Every time the user needs to perform some transactions he has to go to bank and perform 
the necessary actions, which may not be so feasible all the time. It may be a hard-hitting task for 
the users and the bankers too. The project gives real life understanding of Online Banking 
System and activities performed by various roles in the supply chain. Here, we provide 
automation for banking system through Internet. Online Banking System project captures

**Benefits of Online Banking**

Many of us lead busy lives. Some of us are up before the crack of dawn, getting ourselves 
prepared so we can in turn get our families ready for the day. We rush to work, rush to get the 
kids to school, and at the end of the day we rush home only to brace ourselves for the next day. 
After a hectic day, the last thing you want to do is spend time waiting in line at the bank, or even 
the post office. That's where Online Banking comes in. Many of the benefits of doing our 
banking online are obvious:  
1- You don't have to wait in line.  
2- You don't have to plan your day around the bank's hours.  
3- You can look at your balance whenever you want, not just when you get a statement.  
There are some hidden benefits too. As a young bank customer, you're just learning how to 
manage your money and observe your spending patterns.  
Online banking allows you to watch your money on a daily basis if you want to. By keeping 
close tabs on your funds, you'll always be aware of what's happening in your bank account.  
For those experienced spenders, this option is far more appealing than the sudden discovery that 
you're broke!  
It's also helpful to watch how much interest you're gathering on investments and savings or what 
service charges you have incurred.  
**Most available benefits** 
1. Online banking with key bank is fast, secure, convenient and free.  
2. Quick, simple, authenticated access to accounts via the web application.  
3. Simply scalable to grow with changing system requirement.  
4. Global enterprise wide access to information.  
5. Improved data security, restricting unauthorized access.  
6. Minimize Storage Space.
   
**Future Look**
 
The “Banking Online System is a big and ambitious project. I am thankful for being provided 
this great opportunity to work on it. As already mentioned, this project has gone through 
extensive research work. On the basis of the research work, we have successfully designed and 
implemented banking online System. To know what the future of online banking looks like, it’s 
probably worth looking at the present – online banking isn’t new. When you think of online 
banking, you probably think about a computer (either a desktop or laptop), a three or four step 
security process and then an interface that lets you view the balance of your various bank 
accounts and credit cards, whilst permitting you to transfer money and pay bills. And you’re not 
wrong either. The most valuable future looks are following below:  
1- More branches of the bank, maybe it will be international, that means more ATM machines 
outside.  
2- Customer issues development based on their needs, so the help desk will be aware of their 
needs and easy to use.  
3- Developing a mobile App for banking system that help users to do the obtained his operations 
without go to the bank only he needs to sign in using his A/C NO. And password and then use 
your own PIN. Finally the system will update automatically.

**Conclusion**

This project is developed to nurture the needs of a user in a banking sector by embedding all the 
tasks of transactions taking place in a bank. Future version of this project will still be much 
enhanced than the current version. Writing and depositing checks are perhaps the most 
fundamental ways to move money in and out of a checking account, but advancements in 
technology have added ATM and debit card transactions. All banks have rules about how long it 
takes to access your deposits, how many debit card transactions you're allowed in a day, and how 
much cash you can withdraw from an ATM. Access to the balance in your checking account can 
also be limited by businesses that place holds on your funds.  
Banks are providing internet banking services also so that the customers can be attracted. By 
asking the bank employs we came to know that maximum numbers of internet bank account 
holders are youth and business man. Online banking is an innovative tool that is fast becoming a 
necessity. It is a successful strategic weapon for banks to remain profitable in a volatile and 
competitive marketplace of today. If proper training should be given to customer by the bank 
employs to open an account will be beneficial secondly the website should be made friendlier 
from where the customers can directly make and access their accounts.  
Thus, the Bank Management System it is developed and executed successfully.
